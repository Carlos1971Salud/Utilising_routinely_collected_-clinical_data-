We sought to develop models which could offer adjunctive decision support for BSI management alongside existing diagnostics. 
Utilising data from a diverse cohort of hospitalised patients undergoing blood cultures at Imperial College NHS Trust, London (n=20,850), 
we trained **deep learning** models with **routinely-collected longitudinal biomarker data to predict BSIs** at assessment. Performance in prospective evaluation (n=5,638) was associated with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.96-0.97) and significantly better compared to time-invariant approaches.

### Software implementation

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in the `main` folder. The calculations and figure generation are all run inside [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). The data underlying this study, extracted from Imperial College NHS Trust, is not available for public access due to regulatory restrictions. The data used in this research contains sensitive information subject to legal and ethical constraints, preventing its release to the public.

<!-- Results generated by the code are saved in `results`. -->
